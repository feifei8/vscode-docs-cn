# Deploy a Node.js Application to Azure

In this walkthrough, you will deploy a Node.js application to the Azure cloud, all in a matter of minutes.

## Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-node-git&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-node-git) for a free 30 day account with $200 in Azure credits to try out any combination of services.

You'll need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed locally.

Install the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) which you will use the CLI to do the following:

* Create an Azure Website.
* Set up a deployment pipeline between a local/remote Git repository and the Website.
* View your application's logs (`console.log()` output).

## Install the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is cross platform and runs on Windows, macOS, as well as many different Linux distributions.

> [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### Log In

Once installed, you can use the `az` command from your favorite terminal.

Following the instructions, browse to [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and paste in the 9 character code. When prompted, use the email address and password you used when creating your Azure account.

```bash
$ az login
To sign in, go to https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code BF9BUDLGR to authenticate.
```

## Prerequisite Check

Before we continue, ensure that you have all of the prerequisites properly installed. Type each command and ensure it displays the version you have installed. If your Node.js version is less than 6, please [upgrade](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to the most current LTS ("Long Term Stable") release.

```bash
$ node -v
6.10.2
```

Now check that you have `git` installed. If not, [install](https://git-scm.com/downloads) it and test again.

```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.6.4
```
